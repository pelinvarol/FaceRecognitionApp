# Face Recognition App (On Development)

ML based  Face Recognition project from scratch with Python, OpenCV , Machine Learning Algorithms, Flask and Heroku Deploy.

The project will include:
- Automatic Face Recognition in images and videos
- Automatically detect faces from images and videos
- Evaluate and Tune Machine Learning
- Building Machine Learning Model for Classification
- Make Pipeline Model for deploying your application
- Image Processing with OpenCV
- Data Preprocessing for Images
- Create REST APIs in Flask
- Template Inheritance in Flask
- Integrating Machine Learning Model in Flask App

Current Status: 
The parts of the project related to machine learning have been completed. In Part 4, HTML pages will be created and HTML models will be integrated into Flask. Afterwards, the deployment process will be completed using Heroku and the web application will be ready after that .
